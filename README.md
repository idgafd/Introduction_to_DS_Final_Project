# Introduction_to_DS_Final_Project

This report explores a hybrid approach combining Genetic Algorithms (GA) for strategic route planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) for real-time adjustments in UAV navigation. Tested on a real polygon-based terrain dataset with dynamic hazards, this method enhances route efficiency and adaptability. Results show GA+RL outperforms standalone approaches, offering a scalable solution for UAV operations in complex environments.
